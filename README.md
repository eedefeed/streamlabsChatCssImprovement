# streamlabsChatCssImprovement

This is some quick CSS that improves the legibility of streamlabs's chat box. There's no intention to do fancy tricks, I just wanted text that is actually readable when on top of gameplay footage.

The main issue with the chat box is that the text has no border, so against bright gameplay footage it's completely illegible. I must have tried setting a border but that's commented out so I probably thought that the text border was super ugly and pixelated or something. In the end the solution to make a very subtle border was to make 4 different dropshadows. The dropshadows are offset by small amounts in different x/y coordinates because apparantly that was the way to get it to look nice.

I don't know, it was a long time ago.
