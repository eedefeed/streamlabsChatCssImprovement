# streamlabsChatCssImprovement

This is some quick CSS that improves the legibility of streamlabs's chat box. There's no intention to do fancy tricks, I just wanted text that is actually readable when on top of gameplay footage.

The main issue with the chat box is that the text has no border, so against bright gameplay footage it's completely illegible. I think setting a text border is super ugly which is why it's commented out. In the end the solution to make a very subtle border was to make 4 different dropshadows to create a very subtle border effect. The dropshadows are offset by small amounts in different x/y coordinates because apparantly that was the way to get it to look nice.

I don't know, it was a long time ago.
